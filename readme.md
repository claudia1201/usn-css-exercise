# U.S. News and World Report CSS Exercise

For this exercise you will be building a very simple vertical navigation of
links with icons. There will be a simple hover effect associated with each nav
item. Please take a look at the mock.png and mock-hover.png files included in
this folder to see what you will be building. All the necessary assets to turn
this into working html are included as well.

Your job is to deliver a zipped folder with a working index.html file
containing the working navigation as it was designed in the mocks. Please place
css in a separate folder.

You can structure the html and write the css anyway you see fit. But please
make sure that it functions in IE8+, and the latest Firefox, Safari and Chrome
browsers.

This exercise should be completed four business-days after it is received (so
if you get it on a Monday, return it on a Thursday). We expect you will arrive
at a solution on your own -- feel free to reference online documentation, but
do your own coding. We expect your code to work, but we're also looking at your
style and how you deliver your production code.

Please deliver a zip with your solution and these support files. In the email
cover to your answer, please include a few sentences describing why you solved
the exercise in the way you did.

If you have any questions, please send them by email
to the person who sent you these instructions.
